By visiting, browsing, or otherwise using the Site, you (“you,” “your,” or the “User”) acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms and by our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference.

        <h2 className="mt-6 text-lg font-semibold">1. WHO WE ARE</h2>
        <p>
          Elevate 51 (“Elevate51,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a brand-launch and private-label execution service operated out of Karachi, Pakistan, with affiliated entities in the United Arab Emirates. We help entrepreneurs create, package, and launch consumer-product brands—primarily perfumes, grooming products, and other fast-moving consumer goods—on accelerated timelines. All references in these Terms to “Elevate51” include our owners, directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, affiliates, licensors, and service providers.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">2. ELIGIBILITY AND USER RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>

        <p>
          Elevate51 provides consultancy, brand-building guidance, and done-for-you private-label execution. While we share best practices, samples, and real-world data, the ultimate performance of your brand—sales volume, profitability, or market share—depends on numerous factors beyond our control. Accordingly, you acknowledge and agree that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We do not guarantee any minimum sales, profits, funding, or business success.</li>
          <li>Product formulas, packaging, and marketing suggestions are provided “AS IS” for informational purposes; final decisions rest entirely with you.</li>
          <li>Lead times and delivery dates are estimates; we shall not be liable for delays caused by suppliers, customs, couriers, force-majeure events, or acts of God.</li>
          <li>Regulatory compliance (e.g., import/export requirements, cosmetics or health-authority filings) in any jurisdiction is your sole responsibility unless expressly set out in a signed, separate service agreement.</li>
        </ul>
